# DeepLearningWithPytorch_exercises

[This repository is in process...]

This repository is about the book *"Deep Learning With Pytorch"* by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann, published by Manning Publications.

I started to learn Machine Learning then Deep Learning a few months ago and as you may have guest, many resources are available online. Unfortunalty, lots of those resources appeared to be either too specific, too brief, or not framed enough.
Then, I found this book : *Deep Learning With Pytorch*. You will find all the concepts you need to learn and fully apprehending deep learning and understanding what's under the hood of the Pytorch framework.

In this repository, I provide a correction of the exercise sections that you'll find in the book, at the end of each chapter.
Since I didn't find any correction for those, I tried to give an area for reflection (keep in mind that I'm a begginer in this field).
Again, it is just my way to handle those exercises, feel free to correct me or/and add some ideas.

All lines of code are deeply inspired by the work of the authors.
You can find all the code taken from the book in the authors repository : https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code
